## What is that?

`La-Rinha` is an interpreter for the `rinha language` written in C.

This was a fun challenge created for a competition of interpreters and compilers by a group of independent developers using various programming languages. You can find more details [here](https://github.com/aripiprazole/rinha-de-compiler/blob/main/SPECS.md).

And if you're interested in learning how ancient primates used to create their programming languages, you've come to the right place! There are no `flex`, `bison`, `llvm`, or any other dependencies and dark magic tricks hereâ€”just good old pure `C` using the standard library, simple optimizations, and perhaps some questionable design guided by `XGH`. **:)**

I also tried to provide minimal in-code documentation so that it could be expanded later and generate some useful reference if processed by `Doxygen` or any other automatic documentation tool.
